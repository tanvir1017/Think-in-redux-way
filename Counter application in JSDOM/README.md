## Redux core concept with the vanilla js

- First we have to create a reducer function, which is take two parameter as always. They are;

  - State [initial State]
  - action ü•≥.

    ```
    In the parameter of action, it will be an object. Which should have contain a value called 'Type'. The action value type define that what will do the the reducer function, in short hand we assume that reducer function will conditionally work by action type ‚úî‚úå
    ```

- Then we have to create a store function which is take reducer function as the parameter

  ```
  üëâ const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);
  ```

- After that, we have to dispatch the action by the eventListener or something else. Which will send an action.type to different behave for reducer function

  ```
   üëâ increment.addEventListener("click", () => {
    store.dispatch({
    type: "increment",
    })});
  ```

  ```
  üëâ decrement.addEventListener("click", () => {
     store.dispatch({
         type: "decrement",
   })});
  ```

- The render function will change the UI by the condition. Here is an example.

       create render function const render = () => {const state = store.getState();
        counter.innerText = state.value.toString()
      };

  ```
  the getState() function come from redux cdn
  ```

- After that we have to change the UI by render function manually, because we work in a vanilla js file with Redux Cdn.
- Then we have to subscribed the render function as like mentioned in the below

  - render();

  ```
  call it for default initialization
  ```

  - store.subscribe(render);

  ```
  In top of the line we found the subscribe from the redux(CDN) and it will work after any of the handle is clicked
  ```
